This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript error: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  The `bug.as` file contains code that attempts to access an array element beyond its bounds. The `bugSolution.as` file provides a solution to prevent this error.  This is particularly relevant for beginners learning ActionScript or for developers working with legacy code where such errors might be prevalent.
